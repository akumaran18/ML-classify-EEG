# Training and testing ML models to recognize seizures

## Overview
### Please see assignment_4.docx for a full description
![](./)

This is an example of how to train machine learning models to classify [EEG data](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/eeg/about/pac-20393875) as either indicative of a seizure or not (using SciKit-Learn packages). 'Final_MachineLearning.ipynb' demonstrates each of the the data manipulation steps using EEG data from the 'dataBig' folder.

The contents of the 'dataBig' folder come from this source:

Stevenson, N. J., et al. "A dataset of neonatal EEG recordings with seizure annotations." Scientific data 6 (2019): 190039.
https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201939

The contents of the 'data' folder come from this website: http://epileptologie-bonn.de/cms/front_content.php?idcat=193&lang=3

The 'pyeeg' folder is a required Python package which helps to extract features from EEG data.
